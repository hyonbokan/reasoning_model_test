However, it does not verify that the revealer is the same address who performed the matching unseal.\nA-2: This does not break decentralization or timelock directly, but does introduce a fairness/UX flaw that may break intended assumptions about commitment order.\nA-3: It does not allow direct protocol takeover but does allow unfair advantage and potential griefing among users.\nF-1: This is not a duplicate; it appears unique.\nF-2: The behaviour (any pack owner can reveal any unsealed slot for that packId) is unintended and not documented as such.\nF-3: The exploit is practical and trivial, with an attack scenario clearly possible and feasible on-chain.\nF-4: Not an overflow case.\nF-5: Not a reentrancy finding.\nS-1: The impact is medium: while users do not lose funds directly, randomness/fairness is broken and opportunity loss can occur repeatedly.\nS-2: Likelihood is high: any co-owner of the same packId can do this with minimal requirements.\nS-3: Matrix: Medium impact + High likelihood => High severity.\nX-1: The issue is a genuine bug with a direct exploit path; should not be marked as false positive.",

However, the focus of the finding is predictability of randomness, not reentrancy risk. No evidence of reentrancy here, skip R-2 to R-5.\nA-1: The function in question, reveal(), is restricted to token holders (checked via onlyPackOwner modifier), so not publicly invokable by arbitrary unprivileged users. A-2: This issue does not touch on decentralisation or timelock aspects. A-3: The issue does not allow direct protocol manipulation in the sense of access control, but rather opportunistic pack selection if a miner is highly motivated and able to control block hashes.\nF-1: There is no evidence this finding is duplicated elsewhere. F-2: The behaviour (use of blockhash for randomization) is somewhat documented in the code, but not explicitly called out as \"intended\" as a security mechanism, so not obviously intentional. F-3: The practical exploit path for a miner/validator is possible, but highly impractical unless high incentive exists, as it requires mining or manipulating a future block hash after a user has committed to an action, which is at least partially mitigated by unsealDelay. F-4 & F-5: Not applicable.\nS-1: Impact is low-to-medium—a miner could, with difficulty, skew reward assignments, potentially at the expense of the system’s fairness but not direct loss/theft. S-2: Likelihood is low—successful manipulation is very difficult given the delay and Ethereum consensus properties. S-3: Per the matrix, this is \"low\" severity.\nX-1: This is not a definitive false positive; the concern is valid, but the risk is low due to mitigations.",

The contract uses blockhash of a future block for unpredictability, but miners could, with effort, bias outputs.\nF-4/F-5: Not an overflow or reentrancy false positive.\nS-1: Impact is medium; successful manipulation could allow preferential allocation of valuable NFTs, but the attack is non-trivial and requires significant mining power.\nS-2: Likelihood is low (requires either being the block producer at the right time or collusion; cost is high).\nS-3: According to the matrix, a medium impact combined with low likelihood yields severity \"low\".",

There are no pack- or metadata-related state-changing effects after the external calls to untrusted code.\nR-3: No explicit reentrancy guard present on reveal().\nR-4: The CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern is followed: state mutation comes prior to external/callback execution. This means even if a contract reenters, it cannot double-spend or duplicate unseals because the contract's internal records are already updated and will cause reverts or no-ops on subsequent attempts in the same block.\nR-5: The call to onERC1155Received is external, to msg.sender.\nA-1–A-3: Not relevant as no privileged logic is in scope for this finding.\nF-1: Not a duplicate.\nF-2: The behavior is not specifically documented, but CEI is a well-established mitigation.\nF-3: The issue is not purely theoretical—while core state is protected, griefing via gas or unexpected reentrancy could occur, but practical exploit is limited.\nF-4: Not overflow-related.\nF-5: Because the CEI pattern is respected (critical state updated pre-external call), this matches rule [reentrancy], so the report is a false positive per mitigation guidelines.\nS-1: Impact is low—core balance/state is already safe from double spending or duplication.\nS-2: Likelihood is low—requires an attacker to deploy an ERC1155Receiver contract and does not lead to loss of assets, only possible griefing.\nS-3: Matrix = low.\nX-1: Removal is warranted since [reentrancy] rules specify that findings should be removed if pattern or guard is in place.",

Only the deployer (privileged) can set `unsealDelay`. It cannot be changed post-deployment. End users cannot manipulate it — so there is no direct access control violation.\n4. A-2/A-3: The risk is not decentralization or protocol capture, but a possible denial-of-service (DoS) or fully broken reveal/randomness mechanism if `unsealDelay` is improperly set.

F-2: There is no documentation indicating that unlimited values for `unsealDelay` are intentional or desired.\n7.

However, any pack owner can increase the array for a given packId, potentially impacting others.\nA-2: There are no strong decentralisation or timelock promises in documentation, but the access control is role-based for minting and admin.\nA-3: The described issue (DoS via shared global slot) does not allow protocol-wide manipulation, but can lock out users from unsealing packs for a given packId unless other users reveal and pop the array.\nF-1: No evidence this is formally duplicated elsewhere in the report.\nF-2: The behavior is not documented as intentional; the issue looks accidental.\nF-3: The issue is practical: a single user with a low-value pack could block all others from unsealing by incrementing the array size enough (via repeated unseals then ceasing participation).\nF-4-F-5: Not an overflow or reentrancy case.\nS-1: Impact is Medium — users may be permanently (or for a long duration) prevented from unsealing, leading to funds/assets denial rather than outright loss.\nS-2: Likelihood is High — any user can easily trigger this, and there's no restriction beyond their own pack balance.\nS-3: Matrix: Impact (Medium) × Likelihood (High) = High Severity.\nX-1: This is not a false positive; the finding is valid and dangerous for protocol users.",

However, in most practical NFT use-cases, while the risk is real, the impact is often limited to potential minor biasing rather than catastrophic manipulation, but this depends on the application deemed 'fairness.'\nF-4, F-5: Not an overflow or reentrancy case.\nS-1 (Impact): The ability for miners (or advanced users) to bias outcomes could affect fairness and perceived value, especially if pack contents are high-value. This ranges from low (if packs are mostly fungible or of low individual value) to medium (if fairness is significant to the protocol).\nS-2 (Likelihood): Within the 256-block window, a miner with sufficient influence or user collusion could exploit bias. However, realistically, most users can't force their reveal in a specific block, so likelihood is medium.\nS-3: Using the matrix (impact: medium, likelihood: medium), severity is medium.\nX-1: The issue is real, not a false positive, but its risk may be application-dependent.",

R-1: The affected functions (unseal, reveal) do eventually call external NFT contracts in reveal (nft1.mint, etc.), but the issue at hand is not concerned with reentrancy but with pack control logic integrity.\n3. A-1: The issue is that the protocol allows any pack owner to perform a reveal after any unseal for the packId, due to the use of `unsealBlocks[packId]` as a global per-packId queue, not tracking per-user state. This enables a pack holder to take advantage of another user's unseal, thus performing a reveal they did not initiate.\n4. A-2: This does not violate decentralization/timelock assumptions directly, but does impact fairness/user trust assumptions for pack use.\n5. A-3: The lack of per-user unseal tracking does not directly lead to critical protocol manipulation, but it does permit an unfair advantage (front-running someone else's commit), resulting in an ability to cause unintended consumption of pack opportunities.\n6. F-1: There is no indication this finding is duplicated.\n7. F-2: The behavior is not documented as intentional; nothing in the docstring, comments, or naming signals this was by design.\n8. F-3: The exploit path is practical: a user can easily wait for another to unseal, then immediately reveal and consume the metadata.\n9. S-1: Impact - At worst, an unfair loss of pack opportunity (i.e., a user loses their pack or metadata to another). Medium impact as it may result in quantifiable financial/user-loss opportunity.\n10. S-2: Likelihood - High, because any user aware of the bug can exploit anyone else's unseal on the same packId as there are no barriers; practical.\n11. S-3: According to the severity matrix, Medium (impact) × High (likelihood) = High severity.\n12. X-1: This is not a false positive; it is a genuine logic flaw with likely exploitability.",
