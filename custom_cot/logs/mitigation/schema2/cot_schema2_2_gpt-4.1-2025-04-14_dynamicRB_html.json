F-2: There's no mention that the behavior is intended. F-3: The exploitability is valid: a user could trigger revert by causing a large negative bonus.

O-4: There is no business requirement here for non-standard overflow handling. O-5: The overflow would only affect the loop counter; no exploit chain or security failure is possible. F-3: Practically, the size of the array is capped (there is an explicit check preventing more than 11 staked Munchables per mainAccount), so the loop counter cannot approach the uint8 limit (255). The mismatch is a matter of code cleanliness, not realistic overflow risk. S-1: Impact is very low—no user or asset can be exploited, at most a future code maintenance bug. S-2: Likelihood is extremely low due to the hard, enforced cap. S-3: The vulnerability is theoretical only, does not result in a bug with current restrictions, and would be caught either by Solidity's checks or the explicit cap. Therefore, finding should be downgraded to 'best practices' or removed as a false positive.

F-2: Not documented as intentional. F-3: This is not merely theoretical: if a Realm or Rarity value is corrupted or bonus array is too short, farming will indeed revert for affected accounts.
