It’s not a reentrancy flaw: although reveal() calls external NFT contracts, the CEI pattern (state changes before interactions) and absence of post‐call state mutations mitigate reentrancy. 3. The core problem is fairness: unsealBlocks is a single array per packId shared by all users, so a front‐running user can pop another user’s ready block, burn their own pack, and claim the NFTs. 4. This is a practical vulnerability with high likelihood and medium impact on users’ ability to fairly claim NFTs.",

The problem is real (not theoretical or documented), cannot be exploited by a third party after deployment but will cause DoS if misconfigured, so it's a valid finding.

F-3: This is a practical exploit.  F-4/F-5: Not an overflow issue; CEI prevents reentrancy risk.  S-1: Impact is high because packs/NFTs can become irrecoverably bricked.

No external untrusted calls or reentrancy patterns are implicated by using blockhash, so reentrancy rules do not apply.\n4. Access control for reveal() is enforced via onlyPackOwner, so no privileged function is exposed to unprivileged actors.\n5. The randomness risk is documented as a theoretical vector for miners to bias blockhash outcomes; it is not duplicated elsewhere, nor purely hypothetical, but requires significant mining influence.\n6. Impact is a potential bias in NFT assignment (medium impact) and likelihood is low because it requires miner block control and sufficient unsealDelay makes manipulation more difficult.\n7.
