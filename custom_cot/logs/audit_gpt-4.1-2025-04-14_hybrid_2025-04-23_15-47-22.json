However, the logic flaw allows a user A to unseal a pack, transfer it to user B, and have B reveal, which may let B benefit from A's action (and/or vice versa, if B unseals and A reveals post-transfer) - but only for owners, and only if transfers occur in a narrow timing window.\nA-2: There are no decentralization/timelock promises documented that this behavior would violate, but the issue does permit a privilege boundary cross (A unsealing, B revealing), though only through a specific transfer sequence.\nA-3: The flaw could potentially enable one user to get a specific metadata result intended for another, providing minor manipulation over pack assignment, but does not obviously enable full protocol takeover or major asset theft.\nF-1: No duplicate finding is evident in this report.\nF-2: The behavior is not clearly documented as intentional; it seems accidental (the contract comment says 'allowing multiple unseals per pack ID', but not cross-user unseal/reveal), so not a documented or intended design feature.\nF-3: The issue is not purely theoretical; a race condition/manipulation is practically possible if packs are transferred at apt times.\nF-4/F-5: Not an overflow or reentrancy false positive, so those do not apply.\nS-1: Impact is medium; the worst realistic outcome is a user manipulating which account receives a revealed metadata/NFT from a pack, possibly resulting in unfair distributions or bypass of unseal/reveal randomness. But no funds or full packs are at stake, and only a limited amount of user advantage is plausible.\nS-2: Likelihood is low to medium; only users willing to actively coordinate transfers and know the exploit details can benefit, and only under specific circumstances involving rapid transfers and reveals. Most users would not fall victim, and broader protocol threat is minimal. Real-world exploitation is thus at most medium, likely low.\nS-3: Matrix: Impact medium, Likelihood low ➔ Severity: Low.\nX-1: The issue is not a definite false positive, as a real exploit avenue is present, though its severity is moderate.",

No generic access control flaw.\nA-2/A-3: No explicit decentralisation, timelock, or critical manipulation issue—a user can always attempt to reveal when owning a pack, subject to the availability and operability of the external NFT contracts.\nF-1: No indication this is duplicated elsewhere in the report.\nF-2: The dependency on external NFT contracts is visible and implicit by constructor argument, but this design is not explicitly documented as an intended feature or limitation.\nF-3: The risk is primarily operational (the external NFT contracts may fail for reasons outside this contract's logic). It is not purely theoretical, as a failure or pause in any NFT contract would indeed block reveal().\nF-4/F-5: Not applicable.\nS-1: Impact is low. The worst-case effect is a denial of 'reveal' functionality due to external NFT contract failure. No funds lost or irreversible loss; disruption is real but limited.\nS-2: Likelihood is low to medium, as long as the operator manages all contracts reasonably. If management is poor, likelihood could increase, but typically these contracts are controlled together.\nS-3: According to the severity matrix, 'low' impact and 'low' to 'medium' likelihood gives 'low' severity.

Anyone can exploit this as described by the finding.\nS-1: Impact: The impact is medium: the manipulation may allow some users to extract slightly better outcomes, but the economic effect depends on the value of NFTs (potentially high but likely not total theft or protocol shutdown).\nS-2: Likelihood: Medium, as the ability for miners/builders to manipulate is conditional and the ability for users to self-select is broadly accessible; however, not every unseal/reveal may result in valuable bias and most users will not actively exploit the pattern.

There is no explicit statement in comments of intent to make it manipulable, but the chosen design is clear.\nF-3: The issue is only practically exploitable by miners, and only if the unseal delay is very small and if the miner can regularly win blocks at just the right moments. For most users, this risk is theoretical but potentially real for highly motivated miners on low-security chains or low delay settings.\nF-4-F-5: N/A.\nS-1: Impact is low—while the mechanism could be gamed by a miner, such attacks are costly, chain-dependent, and only work for a subset of rare users controlling block production; the value at risk per exploit is likely capped (a single/unsealed pack per attempt) and the overall protocol is not compromised.\nS-2: Likelihood is low to medium, depending on the value of the packs, miner incentives, and operational conditions (delay, chain security). For mainnet Ethereum, such targeting is very unlikely (expensive); for smaller chains or small delay settings, it's slightly more plausible.\nS-3: Matrix assessment (low impact x low/medium likelihood) maps to 'low' (if cautious) or even 'info'.\nX-1: This is not a definite false positive—it is a classic limitation of on-chain pseudo-randomness and worth awareness, even if low severity.",

Thus, state changes (consumption of unseal slots and metadata updates) occur before external contract interaction.\nR-3: No explicit reentrancy guard (e.g., nonReentrant) is present in 'reveal'.\nR-4: The function generally respects Checks-Effects-Interactions: the state is updated before external calls, mitigating classic reentrancy risk.\nR-5: The call is external (to NFT contracts), not internal.\nA-1: Any user with a pack can invoke 'unseal' or 'reveal' for that packId, regardless of whether they were the original unsealer of a pending reveal slot.\nA-2: This design does break expected per-user isolation. There is a strong implicit assumption that a user's unsealing corresponds to their own future reveal opportunity.\nA-3: Yes, this allows theft and denial-of-service by enabling one user to claim another user's unseal slot or prevent new unseals, imposing a critical and abusive manipulation vector.\nF-1: There is no evidence this finding is duplicated elsewhere.\nF-2: There is no documentation stating this shared unseal pool is by design or intentionally exposes users to theft/DoS.\nF-3: The exploit is practical: another user can reveal a slot they did not unseal, burning their own pack but stealing the reward or blocking others from progressing.\nF-4/F-5: Not overflow or reentrancy false positive.\nS-1: Impact is high, as users can lose access to their earned rewards or have their packs DoSed by others.\nS-2: Likelihood is high due to low technical barriers (all pack holders share a global queue and can attempt to exploit).\nS-3: Matrix = High (impact) x High (likelihood) → High.\nX-1: The issue is definitely real and not a false positive.",

The risk is tied to address validity, not to reentrancy specifically.\nR-2: State changes (updating storage and burning the pack) happen before the external calls, which suggests CEI is followed (except for the minting of a new pack at ID 0, but NFT mints occur after state changes of the core contract).\nR-3: No explicit reentrancy guard is present, but due to the order of operations this does not appear exploitable via reentrancy in this context.\nR-4: CEI is generally followed—all internal state management is done before external NFT minting calls.\nR-5: The calls are to external contracts, not internal.\nA-1: Only roles with MINTER_ROLE (assigned appropriately via AccessControl) may set the NFT addresses at deploy time; after deployment, these are immutable and cannot be changed.\nA-2: There's no explicit violation of decentralisation or timelocks; the main issue is the criticality of correct address input at deployment.\nA-3: The issue would not allow malicious manipulation post-deployment, but deploying with an invalid address will critically break the core feature (NFT minting on reveal), resulting in unrecoverable funds/NFTs.\nF-1: No duplicate found in the given report context.\nF-2: The behavior is not documented as an intentional omission.\nF-3: The exploit path is practical: forgetfully deploying with a zero address or non-contract address would break the contract's reveal feature, causing permanent DoS for users.\nF-4, F-5: Not applicable, not an overflow or reentrancy issue per se.\nS-1: Impact is High because it can irreversibly break a core protocol feature (users can never complete pack opening or get NFTs if wrong addresses are used).\nS-2: Likelihood is Medium—deployers are usually careful but mistakes with constructor arguments do occur, and lack of validation makes this more likely.\nS-3: Per the matrix, High Impact and Medium Likelihood yields a Medium severity.\nX-1: The finding is not a definite false positive; it highlights a real risk that warrants improvement.",

However, these NFTs are set via constructor to specific addresses presumably under contract control, not arbitrary user input or untrusted third parties. Also, the code executes effects (state-changing burn and pop operations) before the external calls, so CEI pattern is respected. No unguarded, unsafe external call before state changes.\nA-1: The reveal() function is callable by any owner of the relevant pack (enforced by onlyPackOwner). This matches expected permissioning and does not allow privilege escalation to non-owners. No improper access.\nF-1: The finding does not appear to be duplicated elsewhere in the report.\nF-2: The current event emission pattern is somewhat by convention, but not strictly documented. There are already events for unseal and adding metadata, but reveal lacks an explicit event. However, standard ERC1155 events like TransferSingle fire for the main state changes (mint/burn), and the additional event is more for UX/off-chain convenience than critical protocol monitoring.\nF-3: The issue is more about off-chain monitoring convenience than a practical, on-chain security exploit. External entities can still observe TransferSingle events but may find it less convenient.\nS-1: Impact is low—as the absence of explicitly named events does not pose a direct security risk or core protocol flaw, only affects UI/off-chain integration ease.\nS-2: Likelihood is medium, since it's likely external dApps or users may want more specific events for off-chain use.\nS-3: Using the matrix: low (impact) x medium (likelihood) = low. However, since the problem is mostly an off-chain UX/convenience deficiency, it might arguably be further demoted to 'info', but given the matrix, we assign 'low'.\nX-1: The finding should not be removed outright, as the recommendation may still benefit off-chain consumers.",
