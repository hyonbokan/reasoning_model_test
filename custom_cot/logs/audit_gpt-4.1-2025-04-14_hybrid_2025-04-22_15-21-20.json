If miner manipulation occurs, it could skew valuable NFT allocation, but not cause total system compromise; users are still required to own and unseal packs.\nS-2: Likelihood is low to medium.

The affected functions (`reveal` and `unseal`) manipulate only the caller's slot in `unsealBlocks[packId]`, not all users, as mapping keys in Solidity are per address. The risk is that a single address could make their `unsealBlocks[packId]` very large for themselves, but it does NOT affect all users globally or the pack's global state. There is no iteration over the whole mapping, just pop and push on individual arrays. Thus, this is only a potential DoS/vulnerability for users who deliberately abuse their own slot, not for the system as a whole.\nF-4–F-5: Not relevant since this is not overflow or reentrancy.\nS-1: Impact—low (users who spam their own `unsealBlocks[packId]` can DoS or make their own reveals expensive).\nS-2: Likelihood—low (only malicious or careless users will hit this, and only their own account is affected).\nS-3: Matrix—Impact low, Likelihood low → \"low\" severity.\nX-1: Should this be removed? No—the theoretical risk is plausible for a user attacking their own entry, but the DoS scope is local, not global.",
      "reasoning_summary": "The DoS risk affects only individual users who heavily spam `unseal` on their own packs; it does not globally threaten the contract and is not a systemic vector.

Overflow rules are not relevant.\nR-1: The referenced vulnerable functions (unseal and reveal) do not call external untrusted contracts during the critical state change (the external NFT mints in reveal() happen after the burn/mint of ERC1155 and removal from metadata pool, but do not process user-controlled low-level calls).\nR-2: State changes (updating unsealBlocks, metadataPool, burning pack, etc.) occur before external NFT contract mints, which do happen at the end – but the NFT contracts seem under deployer control only and are type-safe, reducing typical reentrancy vectors here. Still, because the external call to NFT.mint occurs last, reentrancy would require a malicious NFT contract, which isn't a typical threat in this scenario.\nR-3: No explicit reentrancy guard, but the CEI pattern is largely respected (see above).\nR-4: CEI is mostly followed because effects on state (unsealBlocks, metadataPool) are stored before any external call.\nR-5: The finding is not about internal vs. external calls; it's about state mapping of the unsealBlocks array.\nA-1: Any pack holder can call unseal and reveal, but not a non-holder (due to onlyPackOwner). The problem is intra-group – one pack holder can claim another user's commit, not true public privilege escalation.\nA-2: There is no evidence of decentralisation/timelock violation; the problem is fairness, not protocol-wide governance or critical tampering.\nA-3: The core impact is that pack reveals can be front-run or 'stolen' by other pack holders, so users racing can get unfairly blocked with someone else grabbing their unseal, but not protocol takeover or critical manipulation.\nF-1: No duplication apparent in this report.\nF-2: This behavior appears unintentional and is not documented as such.\nF-3: It is not purely theoretical; a practical exploit path exists: pack holders can trigger an unseal commit, and other holders can reveal before the committer, stealing their pack. \nF-4-F-5: Not an overflow or reentrancy false positive.\nS-1: Impact is low. The consequence is unfairness and loss of packs for a pack holder due to someone else racing to reveal using a different account, but neither catastrophic loss nor control.\nS-2: Likelihood is medium. In a competitive environment with multiple pack holders unsealing concurrently, the exploit could be repeatedly performed.\nS-3: From the matrix, Low (impact) + Medium (likelihood) = Low severity.\nX-1: The finding is a real issue regarding fairness; should not be removed, but classified as severity low.",
