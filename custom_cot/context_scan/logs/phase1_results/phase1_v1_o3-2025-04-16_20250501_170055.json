During the re-entrant context the contract still believes the plot is free and that the player has fewer than 10 staked NFTs.  The attacker can therefore stake the same or additional NFTs multiple times, violate the 10-NFT limit, or occupy multiple plots that will later all be considered legitimately staked once the first call returns and finalises the state updates.\n\nWHY:  The contract violates the checks-effects-interactions pattern; state invariants are only enforced after the external interaction, leaving a window where they can be bypassed.",
