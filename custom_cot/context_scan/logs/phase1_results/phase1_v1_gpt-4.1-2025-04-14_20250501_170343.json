The lack of reentrancy protection (no OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard or similar patterns) exposes the contract to serious logic re-entrancy attacks.

Additionally, plotOccupied and toilerState are updated, but the staked list is not, and no validation ensures the invariants about munchablesStaked contents are preserved relative to plot occupation. WHY: This structure is fragile—should extensions or changes occur, or if bugs or external events cause cross-landlord transfer, historic assumptions may break.

HOW: Since schnibblesTotal is typically a function of time, base rate, and bonus, low-activity or low-reward Munchables may, in some game states, collect zero additional Schnibbles due to truncation.
