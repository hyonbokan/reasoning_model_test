      "Contracts": [

      "Description": "Function \"stakeMunchable\" performs the external call\n```solidity\nmunchNFT.transferFrom(mainAccount, address(this), tokenId);\n```\nBEFORE it writes the critical state variables:\n```solidity\nplotOccupied[landlord][plotId] = ...;\nmunchablesStaked[mainAccount].push(tokenId);\nmunchableOwner[tokenId] = mainAccount;\ntoilerState[tokenId] = ...;\n```\nIf the MunchNFT contract is malicious or upgradeable, it can re-enter LandManager during the transfer (e.g., by calling back into stakeMunchable, unstakeMunchable, etc.). Because the state has not yet been updated, the attacker can:\n• stake multiple NFTs into the same unoccupied plot, ending with mapping inconsistencies (plotOccupied shows token-A while toilerState for token-B also claims the same plot);\n• exceed the intended 10-NFT limit;\n• generally violate invariants inv-5, inv-6, inv-14, inv-19.\nThis breaks the checks-effects-interactions rule and enables loss of accounting integrity or locked assets.",

Subsequent operations (unstakeMunchable, _farmPlots, dirty-flag checks) act on stale data, causing:\n• incorrect reward accounting;\n• attempts to clear / reuse the wrong plot (leading to double-occupancy or locked NFTs);\n• violation of invariants inv-14 and inv-16.",

If a landlord reduces their plots from N to N-1, a token staked on the former highest plot (id N-1) becomes invalid, but the comparison `N-1 < N-1` is false, so the dirty flag is not set.
