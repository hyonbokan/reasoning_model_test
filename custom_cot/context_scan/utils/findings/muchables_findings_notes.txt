S1 (High): Single plot occupied by multiple renters (transferToUnoccupiedPlot plotId not updated).
S2 (High): Invalid validation in _farmPlots allowing repeated farming without locked funds (plotId 0 check).
S3 (High): Miscalculation in _farmPlots leading to inability to unstake (Integer overflow from negative bonus).
S4 (High): Underflow in edge case leading to freeze of funds (_farmPlots with PRICE_PER_PLOT increase and old timestamp).
S5 (High): Failure to update dirty flag in transferToUnoccupiedPlot (prevents reward accumulation). Â  
S6 (Medium): Users can farm on zero-tax land (uninitialized metadata).
S7 (Low): Lingering token approvals.
S8 (Low): Tax rate updates bypass Timestamp refresh (updateTaxRate doesn't update lastUpdated).
S9 (Low): Inaccurate timestamp handling in _farmPlots (using lastUpdated for invalid plots).
S10 (Low): Incorrect staking limit check allows 11 munchables.
S11 (Low): Precision loss in landlord Schnibble calculation.
