This results in a critical minting exploit that could destroy all in-game reward accounting, which is a clear violation of expected protocol behavior (A_3=yes). Since exploitation relies on administrative control, likelihood is 'high' for a malicious takeover or mismanagement, and the business impact is 'high' since rewards become unbounded.

The real-world impact is low—the parties (landlords and renters) may experience slight rounding losses, but this does not significantly damage user funds or protocol economics.

However, this pattern is a well-known limitation of fixed-point arithmetic in Solidity and is a standard precision loss in integer math, not a vulnerability. The possibility of rounding down to zero is expected when the value is less than 1, and fractional tokens are by design not distributable in typical ERC20/ERC721-compatible logic. This behavior is a known Solidity limitation, is documented throughout the ecosystem, and would be widely expected and accepted by protocol users. There is no security exploit or user manipulation vector, only possible (very minor) rounding losses in edge cases with extremely small schnibble amounts. Therefore, the impact is low and there is no indication it violates any business rule or introduces risk beyond minimal rounding loss.",
