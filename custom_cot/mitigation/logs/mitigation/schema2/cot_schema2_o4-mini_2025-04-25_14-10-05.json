The user experience impact is low but the likelihood is high, giving a medium rating by the impact/likelihood matrix; however, since this is a design trade‐off rather than a security bug, it’s more appropriately tagged as a best‐practices issue.

There is no unchecked arithmetic or external untrusted call, and access control is correctly restricted to the token owner, so this is not a false positive under overflow, reentrancy, or access rules. The bug has a clear exploit path: after moving one munchable, the old plot appears free, enabling a second munchable to occupy it while the stale plotId still points to the first token, causing duplicate farming and corrupting reward accounting. Impact is high because it directly corrupts reward distribution and can be exploited to mint extra tokens; likelihood is medium since it requires calling the function under specific conditions. Applying the severity matrix (High impact, Medium likelihood) yields a Medium severity. This is a valid vulnerability and should not be removed.",

It is not a reentrancy issue (R-1–R-5: no external calls, not applicable).\n5. It is not an access-control issue (A-1–A-3: no privileged function exposure).\n6. There is no duplicate finding (F-1: no). The staking limit enforces at most 11 tokens (F-2: yes documented/intended), making >255 iterations impossible; thus this is purely theoretical (F-3: yes).\n7.

Access-control is unaffected: ordinary users call the affected functions legitimately (A-1 through A-3: no). It is not a duplicate finding (F-1: no), not documented design (F-2: no), and has a practical exploit path (F-3: no).

No reentrancy guards or CEI patterns are relevant here (F-5: no).

After transferring the NFT in line 153, the user’s token is held by the contract.  \n4. All unstake paths (`unstakeMunchable`, `transferToUnoccupiedPlot`) trigger `_farmPlots`, which calls `_getMainAccountRequireRegistered(landlord)` and reverts if `landlord` is unregistered, preventing any way to reverse the stake.  \n5. This is a practical exploit path with significant impact (permanent NFT loss) and high likelihood given any unregistered address can be used as `landlord`.  \n6.

The contract uses pragma solidity 0.8.25, so automatic overflow/underflow checks are enabled and there is no unchecked block around this operation.  \n3. There is no requirement to handle rounding differently—this is standard integer division behavior.  \n4. The snippet does not involve any external calls or reentrancy risks, nor does it implicate access control.  \n5. It is not a duplicate finding, not documented by design, and while rounding down is expected, it can systematically deprive landlords of small amounts.  \n6. Impact is purely economic (low), likelihood is high for small schnibble totals; thus according to the severity matrix the issue rates as medium.  \n7. The finding is valid (not a false positive) and recommends a precision‐improving approach.",
